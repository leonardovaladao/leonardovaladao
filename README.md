# Leonardo ValadÃ£o

## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a physics undergrad student living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Currently I'm working on a research about physics episthemology, and another research about physics concepts behind science fiction. On the side, I study programming and create my own projects to sell or just for fun. <br/>
I love solving math problems with programming and developing new applications from scratch!
