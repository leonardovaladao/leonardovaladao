# Leonardo Valad√£o

In an increasingly connected world and with information available more and more easily, to change lives through technology isn't just a possibility, but a requirement.
That's my purpose: To better and transform people's lives through technological solutions.

I am a data scientist, a researcher in the field of Science Studies, and a Physics undergrad. I have experience with data analysis, database management and front-end web development.
